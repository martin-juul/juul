        I'd like to share my experience as a programmer. I have always been interested
        in programming since childhood, when computers were mainly used for mathematical purposes. Though programming
        was never really difficult for me due to my high level of comprehension, it wasn't until I started working on
        web applications that I realized how versatile programming can be. However, the real challenge came when I
        started developing mobile apps â€“ something that not many people are familiar with these days!

        I love programming and I am very passionate about it. Programming is my way of expressing myself, both in terms
        of the code that I write and also how I code. It's a way for me to connect with others on an intellectual level,
        without any verbal or nonverbal cues required. It's a form of communication that allows me to share ideas, solve
        problems and make things work the way they should- all while being confined within the constraints of computer
        codes!

        I had always loved playing with computers and tinkering with them. I used to be really good at Lego. As I grew
        older, my love for computers only increased. Software engineering was the perfect profession for me. It is an
        ever-growing and challenging industry where I can use my creativity, ingenuity, and problem-solving skills. It
        is my passion and I am driven to invent new features that will make people's lives better. I enjoy interacting
        with people, and I am always looking for ways to make my work more efficient and provide my core competencies in
        a cost effective way for the customer and the service provider.
